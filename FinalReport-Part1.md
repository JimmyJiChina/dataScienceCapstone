### the similarity between the Chinese and USA cities
I have 2 friends are applying the migration to USA and they always ask me which city to pick to live.
they both works in big city of China and they prefer living in a similar area.
From my point of view, this kind of requirement is quite common in nowdays China. More and more people are trying to migrate to other country for all kind of reason. But they don't have enough information to support them except those angent company which often give advice with strong bias
