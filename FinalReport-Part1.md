### the similarity between the Chinese and USA cities
I have 2 friends are applying the migration to USA and they always ask me which city to pick to live.
they both work in big cities of China and they prefer living in a similar area when they go to USA.
From my point of view, this kind of requirement is quite common in nowdays China. More and more people are trying to migrate to other country for all kind of reason. But they don't have enough information to support them except those angent company which often give advice with strong bias.
#### the data I am going to use
I would first need the basic information of USA cities dataset, which comes from https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities
the dataset list all the cities of USA, updated Apri, 2018. the information include the lat/lon , population. So first step would be choose top 100 towns which are most similar with Nanjing, which is the city where my friend live.
then foursqure dataset could be used to compare these 100 towns and nanjing. I plan to use several dimension data to measure the "similarity", including the food type, city area, venues density, etc.
